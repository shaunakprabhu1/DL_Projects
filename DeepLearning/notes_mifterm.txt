Hey Akash,
I recently got a mail from Cigna asking me to interview for the data science intern-Express Scripts position.
I came across your profile and wanted to know of your experience at Cigna and would really appreciate it if you could tell me a bit about the interview process and the kind of topics you recommend I should read up on.
Thanks a lot for your time, 
Shaunak Prabhu
